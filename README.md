DMG EQUITY defines equity in three traditional ways.

1) Fairness or justice in the way people are treated. Justice according to natural law or right specifically freedom from bias or favoritism. DMG EQUITY FINANCE realizes equity within the organization by utilizing and innovating the structure of the traditional DAO.

2) The value of an asset after any debts that remain to be paid for it have been subtracted. Equity in this context is defined by the sum total of the accumulated DMG EQUITY TREASURY.

3) A share in a company a share of a company's stock. DMG is a decentralized merger group. Equity in this sense is the accumulation of shares, majority or otherwise, in secondary assets that support the value of DMG EQUITY FINANCE and the DMG EQUITY FINANCE TREASURY.

Definitions
DAO = Decentralized Autonomous Organization
While many projects claim DAO status most miss the mark by not being Autonomous. DMG EQUITY FINANCE believes that we have achieved the logical steps necessary to create a DAO that is truly equitable.
